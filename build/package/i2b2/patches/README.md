# Patches

The `install-i2b2.sh` script will apply to the i2b2 source code all the patches contained in this folder before compiling i2b2.

The patches must have the file extension `.diff` and be generated by git with `git diff -p` as they are applied with `git apply`.

## `crc_pg_db_fix.diff`
This patch fixes an i2b2 bug in the CRC that is triggered only when a postgresql database is used.
